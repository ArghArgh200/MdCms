MdCms
=====

Content Management System that uses Markdown to display the pages. 

Basically you make your Markdown pages with links and images and whatnot, then you put them in md/, then you browse to the index page. Simple.

Configuration's a breeze:
Edit settings.json. Make sure there are no spaces or newlines outside the quotes. Escape /'s with a backslash (\) Example: http:\/\/github.com\/


Uses Michel Fortin's PHP Markdown parser.
